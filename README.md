> - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
> - Add new todos to the list

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM
- SASS
- JavaScript
- LocalStorage
- SortableJS


### Highlights / Features
- I used ***SortableJS*** library for drag and drop to reorder list. I disabled the sortable when options ‘Active’ or ‘Completed’ are selected.
- Theme and list tasks are stored in ***Local Storage***. It was my first time using it and I had some troubles with the script when todo list was empty. Finally, I think I made it work.
